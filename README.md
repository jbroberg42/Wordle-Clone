# Wordle Clone
Wordle Clone is a python program that runs in the command line.  It aims to simulate the popular word game.  Wordle Clone selects a word at random from a text file and prompts the user to guess the word.  If you can't guess it within 6 tries, you lose!
Note: If you can't see colored Emoji feedback squares (â¬œ,ðŸŸ©,ðŸŸ¥) while playing the game, try changing your CLI font.
